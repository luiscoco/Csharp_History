//Warning Wave 7 in C# 11 introduces new compiler warnings that aim to help developers identify and fix potential issues
//in their code before they become problems at runtime. These warnings cover a range of issues, from more precise nullability
//warnings to code quality improvements and potential pitfalls in code logic. The specific warnings introduced in Warning Wave 7
//can help catch bugs earlier in the development cycle, making the code more robust and maintainable.

//Unfortunately, as of my last update in April 2023, detailed specifics about each warning included in Warning Wave 7
//were not extensively documented in a way that could be succinctly summarized. However, I can demonstrate a generic example
//of how you might encounter and address a new compiler warning in C# 11. This example will focus on handling a hypothetical
//new warning related to nullability, as nullability has been a significant focus of recent C# enhancements.

string? maybeNull = GetNullableString();
PrintNonNullString(maybeNull); // Hypothetical Warning Wave 7 might warn here

static string? GetNullableString()
{
    // Simulate a condition that might return null
    return DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Monday ? "It's Monday" : null;
}

static void PrintNonNullString(string nonNullString)
{
    Console.WriteLine(nonNullString);
}
