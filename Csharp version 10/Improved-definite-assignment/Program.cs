//In C# 10, the definite assignment analysis has been improved to reduce the number of false positives—situations
//where the compiler previously warned about variables that may not have been assigned before use, even though
//the code logic ensured their assignment. These improvements help in scenarios where the compiler can more accurately
//determine if a variable has been assigned in all possible execution paths, reducing unnecessary initialization
//and making the code cleaner and more efficient.

int result;

bool condition = DateTime.Now.Second % 2 == 0; // Condition based on the current second being even or odd

if (condition)
{
    result = 1; // Assign a value if the condition is true
}
else
{
    result = 2; // Assign a different value if the condition is false
}

// In C# 9 and earlier, the compiler might not recognize that 'result' is definitely assigned
// In C# 10, the compiler understands that 'result' is assigned in all execution paths
Console.WriteLine($"The result is {result}");
