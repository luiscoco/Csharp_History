//The #line pragma in C# has been enhanced in C# 10 to support more granular control over line numbers and file paths
//in compiler-generated output, making it easier for developers to manage the debugging experience and error reporting
//in generated code. This enhancement is particularly useful in scenarios involving source generators or other code
//generation techniques, where you want to point the developer to a specific line in the original source file, rather
//than in the generated code, for diagnostics or debugging purposes.

//The enhanced #line pragma allows specifying a file path and line number directly in the pragma, improving the accuracy
//and utility of compiler error messages and debugger source mapping. This can make debugging more intuitive and efficient
//by directing the developer to the correct location in the source code.

//To demonstrate the enhanced #line pragma, we'll create a simple console application. We'll simulate a scenario where
//the #line pragma is used to manipulate the compiler's view of file names and line numbers, which can be particularly
//illustrative of its benefits in generated code.
