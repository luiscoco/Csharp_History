## 1. C# Version 1.0

C# version 1.0, released with Visual Studio .NET 2002

The major features of C# 1.0 included:

**Classes** (object oriented programming features)

**Structs**

**Interfaces**

**Events**

**Properties**

**Delegates**

**Operators and expressions**

**Statements**

**Attributes**

## 2. C# Version 1.2

C# version 1.2 shipped with Visual Studio .NET 2003

Most notable is that starting with this version, the code generated in a **foreach loop** called **Dispose** on an **IEnumerator** when that **IEnumerator** implemented **IDisposable**.

## 3. C# Version 2.0

Let's take a look at some major features of C# 2.0, released in 2005, along with Visual Studio 2005:

**Generics**

**Partial types**

**Anonymous methods**

**Nullable value types**

**Iterators**

**Covariance and contravariance**

Other C# 2.0 features added capabilities to existing features:

**Getter/setter separate accessibility**

**Method group conversions (delegates)**

**Static classes**

**Delegate inference**

## 4. C# Version 3.0

C# version 3.0 came in late 2007, along with Visual Studio 2008, though the full boat of language features would actually come with .NET Framework version 3.5.

C# 3.0 had begun to lay the groundwork for turning C# into a **hybrid Object-Oriented / Functional language**.

Let's take a look at some major features in this version:

**Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)**

**Auto-implemented properties**

**Anonymous types**

**Query expressions**

**Lambda expressions**

**Expression trees**

**Extension methods**

**Implicitly typed local variables**

**Partial methods**

**Object and collection initializers**

## 5. C# Version 4.0

C# version 4.0, released with Visual Studio 2010

This version introduced some interesting new features:

**Dynamic binding**

**Named/optional arguments**

**Generic covariant and contravariant**

**Embedded interop types**

## 6. C# Version 5.0

C# version 5.0, released with Visual Studio 2012

Nearly all of the effort for that version went into another groundbreaking language concept: the **async** and **await** model for asynchronous programming

Here's the major features list:

**Asynchronous members**

**Caller info attributes**

**Code Project: Caller Info Attributes in C# 5.0**

## 7. C# Version 6.0

Version 6.0, released with Visual Studio 2015

Here are some of them:

**Static imports**

**Exception filters**

**Auto-property initializers**

**Expression bodied members**

**Null propagator**

**String interpolation**

**nameof operator**

Other new features include:

**Index initializers**

**Await in catch/finally blocks**

**Default values for getter-only properties**

## 8. C# Version 7.0

C# version 7.0 was released with Visual Studio 2017

Here are some of the new features:

**Out variables**

**Tuples and deconstruction**

**Pattern matching**

**Local functions**

**Expanded expression bodied members**

**Ref locals**

**Ref returns**

Other features included:

**Discards**

**Binary Literals and Digit Separators**

**Throw expressions**
